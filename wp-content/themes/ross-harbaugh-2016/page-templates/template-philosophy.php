        <p>Every student I teach is absolutely unique, with a unique background, training, interest level, and talent. I find that fascinating! Teaching has been the greatest adventure! I’ve had to relearn how to play the cello several times over in order to help my students achieve their potential on the instrument. I’m always looking for more efficient, more clearly understandable, more successful ways to teach students how to play the cello--and that has been a fantastic growing experience for me.</p>

        <p>My students know I love the feeling of making music on our beloved instrument, the cello. I try everything I can think of to make the playing of the cello a joyful experience. To make a big, beautiful sound that’s free and ringing and powerful—what could be more fun? And my students know I love to perform. I try to share that love with them at every lesson and in every concert.</p>

        <p>Playing the right notes at the right time is only one of 20 things a student needs to know to be a successful musician. To be successful interpreters of music, they need to know the historical setting of the music, the harmonic context of the melodies, the tactile sense of the sounds they want to produce, the colors, pacing, shaping, and tones of voice that will make their music live.</p>

        <p>But they also need to know how to write, create media, market their skills, communicate from the stage with an audience, or face to face with a potential patron. The experience-centric  curriculum at the Frost School helps them hear music like a composer. They study sight-singing, composition, improvisation, and even musical history (at times) with the instrument in hand.</p>

        <p>I hope the young cellists of today will find new ways of keeping our beloved art alive and well. The Frost School is the perfect place to explore that goal.</p>
